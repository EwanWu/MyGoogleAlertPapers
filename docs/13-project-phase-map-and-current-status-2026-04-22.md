# Project phase map and current status (2026-04-22)

## Purpose

This is the current top-level entry for the project after Track A, Track B, and the integrated mainline validation.

Read this first if you need the shortest path to:
1. current default strategy
2. what has been decided and frozen
3. what remains open
4. what evidence is canonical

## One-line status

The project is now in:

> **mainline convergence / default-flow solidification**

The pipeline is no longer mainly exploring strategy space. The current work is about locking one coherent default path, keeping only narrow retained patches, and validating that path on new slices.

## Current default pipeline

`Google Scholar alert emails -> candidate extraction -> normalization -> bibliographic enrich -> merge -> dedup -> post-dedup OA enhancement`

Operationally:
1. `scan-mailbox`
2. `parse-mails`
3. `normalize-candidates`
4. `enrich-candidates`
5. `merge-metadata`
6. `dedup-candidates`
7. `enrich-paper-oa`

## Stable project decisions

### 1. Bibliographic baseline stays on `conditional_sources_v2`
Broader fallback-tightening variants did not survive larger fixed-seed comparison.

### 2. Track A retained patch is narrow and late
The only Track A patch worth keeping is:
- `conditional_sources_v2_author_blob_fallback_only`

Its role is not broad anti-garbage filtering. Its role is to block one narrow bad-shape class only at final `normalized_only` fallback acceptance.

### 3. Track B is now closed
Unpaywall should not be used as a normal candidate-level enrich provider.

Its retained production role is:
- post-dedup OA enhancement over canonical DOI

## What the latest integrated validation established

Using reused source records to eliminate live-provider variability:
- Track A treatment removed the target garbage case only
- no collateral-loss candidates were introduced
- review burden did not worsen
- severe DOI conflict burden did not worsen
- post-dedup OA stage added 156 OA URLs on 263 canonical DOI-carrying papers

## What is still open

The main unresolved problem is no longer policy ranking within this branch. It is **generalization**.

The next useful validation is:
- run the converged mainline on a genuinely fresh slice
- preferably from new mailbox data if IMAP access is restored
- otherwise from a previously unused local cached slice

## What should not be reopened casually

Do not reopen these as default-policy questions unless new evidence appears:
- broad `low_source_title_similarity` blocking
- broad `sparse_metadata_low_source_title_similarity` blocking
- candidate-level Unpaywall as a production enrich provider
- Track A matching-time author-blob filtering
